 * how to find the connected components -> go through bfs -> it gives one connected components add that to one
 * no of bfs -> no of connected components
 * may be like set 0 or set 1 or something like that
 * go for the smallest time consuming in that order to remove the nodes and then we do it again ... and check until no nodes are removed
 * do bruteForce -> again and again to check whether connected components gonna increase or not
