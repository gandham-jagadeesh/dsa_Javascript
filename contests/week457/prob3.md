# Minimum Time Threshold to Get at Least K Connected Components

## Problem Overview

Given a graph with weighted edges, the goal is to find the **minimum time threshold `t`** such that **removing all edges with weight \u2264 `t` results in at least `k` connected components**.

---

## Core Insight

At any threshold `t`, you simulate removing all edges with weight \u2264 `t`. The remaining graph (only using edges with weight > `t`) forms connected components.

The higher the threshold:

* The more edges are removed
* The more disconnected the graph becomes
* The more components you get

This property is **monotonic**, meaning:

* If a threshold `t` works (gives \u2265 `k` components), any larger threshold will also work
* If a threshold `t` fails, any smaller threshold will also fail

This allows us to apply **binary search** on the threshold value.

---

## Binary Search Logic

1. **Search Range**: Set initial binary search range from `low = 0` to `high = max edge weight`
2. **Mid Value**: At each step, calculate `mid = (low + high) / 2`
3. **Simulation**:

   * Remove all edges with weight \u2264 `mid`
   * Keep only edges with weight > `mid`
   * Use **DFS** or **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** to count connected components
4. **Decision**:

   * If `components \u2265 k`, this `mid` works. Try to find a smaller valid threshold (`high = mid - 1`)
   * If `components < k`, not enough disconnection. Increase threshold (`low = mid + 1`)

---

## Optimization Idea

Instead of binary searching from `0` to `1e9`, extract all unique edge weights and sort them. Binary search only over these:

```java
List<Integer> weights = extract all unique weights from edges;
Collections.sort(weights);
Binary search on weights.get(i);
```

This reduces the number of binary search steps significantly (from \~30 to \~log(#edges)).

---

## Why We Move Right When a Threshold Fails

* If `t = 4` fails (too few components), it means we **didn't remove enough edges**
* We increase the threshold (e.g., try `t = 6`) to remove **more** edges
* More removal = more disconnected = more components

---

## Summary Table

| Threshold `t` | Edges Removed (\u2264 `t`) | Graph Becomes     | Components | Action     |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Too Small     | Few edges removed          | Still connected   | < k        | Move right |
| Valid         | More edges removed         | More disconnected | \u2265 k   | Move left  |

---

## Final Summary

* At each binary search step, remove all edges with weight \u2264 `mid`
* Use DSU or DFS to count connected components in the remaining graph
* If the number of components \u2265 `k`, try smaller `mid`
* If fewer than `k`, increase `mid`

This approach ensures you find the **minimum possible threshold** that satisfies the condition.



# Reverse DSU Approach — Building Dense Graph in Reverse

## Problem
Find the smallest edge weight `t` such that if we remove all edges with weight ≤ `t`,  
the graph has **at least** `k` connected components.

---

## Key Idea
Instead of *removing* edges from the graph and re-checking connectivity (which can be costly),  
we **reverse** the process:

1. Sort all edges **by weight descending** (largest first).
2. Start with **n** disconnected nodes (n components).
3. **Add edges** one by one, from largest weight to smallest:
   - Use **DSU (Disjoint Set Union)** to merge components.
   - Track the number of components.
4. When the number of components drops **below** `k`,  
   the **current edge’s weight** is the smallest weight that still keeps components < k.
5. Return this weight.

---

## Why This Works
- Removing small-weight edges until the graph reaches `k` components  
  is equivalent to **adding large-weight edges** until the graph drops below `k`.
- DSU enables near O(1) merges, so we avoid expensive repeated BFS/DFS scans.

---

## Algorithm
```ts
function minTime(n: number, edges: number[][], k: number): number {
    edges.sort((a, b) => b[2] - a[2]); // sort by weight descending
    const dsu = new DSU(n);
    let components = n;

    for (const [u, v, w] of edges) {
        const pu = dsu.findParent(u);
        const pv = dsu.findParent(v);
        if (pu !== pv) {
            dsu.findUnionByRank(u, v);
            components--;
        }
        if (components < k) {
            return w;
        }
    }
    return 0; // if never drops below k
}

# Complexity Analysis
- Sorting: O(E log E)

- DSU Merges: O(E α(N)) ≈ O(E)

- Total: O(E log E)

- Space: O(N) (DSU parent, rank, size arrays)
