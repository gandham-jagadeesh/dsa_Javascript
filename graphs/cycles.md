# Graph Cycle Detection Summary

This document captures everything learned about cycle detection in graphs ‚Äî for both undirected and directed graphs using DFS, BFS, and Kahn's algorithm. It also highlights common misconceptions and implementation observations.

## ‚úÖ Techniques for Cycle Detection

### üîÑ **Undirected Graph**

#### DFS (Depth-First Search)

* Use a `visited` set.
* Keep track of the `parent` node.
* A cycle is found if we reach a `visited` node that is **not** the parent.

```ts
function hasCycleUndirectedDFS(graph: Record<number, number[]>): boolean {
  const visited = new Set<number>();

  function dfs(node: number, parent: number | null): boolean {
    visited.add(node);

    for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        if (dfs(neighbor, node)) return true;
      } else if (neighbor !== parent) {
        return true; // Cycle detected
      }
    }

    return false;
  }

  for (const node in graph) {
    if (!visited.has(Number(node))) {
      if (dfs(Number(node), null)) return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

#### BFS

* Track `(node, parent)` in queue.
* If a visited neighbor is **not** the parent ‚Üí cycle exists.

```ts
function hasCycleUndirectedBFS(graph: Record<number, number[]>): boolean {
  const visited = new Set<number>();

  for (const start in graph) {
    const node = Number(start);
    if (!visited.has(node)) {
      const queue: [number, number | null][] = [[node, null]];
      visited.add(node);

      while (queue.length) {
        const [current, parent] = queue.shift()!;

        for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
          if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
            visited.add(neighbor);
            queue.push([neighbor, current]);
          } else if (neighbor !== parent) {
            return true; // Cycle detected
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return false;
}
```

---

### üîÅ **Directed Graph**

#### DFS

* Use `visited` and `path` tracking (recursion stack).
* A cycle exists if a node is visited **and also in the current path**.

```ts
function hasCycleDirectedDFS(graph: Record<number, number[]>): boolean {
  const visited: Record<number, boolean> = {};
  const path: Record<number, boolean> = {};

  for (const node in graph) {
    visited[node] = false;
    path[node] = false;
  }

  function dfs(node: number): boolean {
    visited[node] = true;
    path[node] = true;

    for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
      if (!visited[neighbor]) {
        if (dfs(neighbor)) return true;
      } else if (path[neighbor]) {
        return true; // Back edge ‚Üí cycle
      }
    }

    path[node] = false; // Backtrack
    return false;
  }

  for (const node in graph) {
    if (!visited[node]) {
      if (dfs(Number(node))) return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}
```

**üß† Observations:**

* `path[node] = false` is crucial ‚Äî it removes the node from current path during backtracking.
* Helps explore alternate branches correctly.

#### BFS ‚Üí Kahn's Algorithm (Topological Sort)

* Compute in-degrees of all nodes.
* Remove nodes with in-degree 0.
* If all nodes are not removed ‚Üí cycle exists.

```ts
function hasCycleDirectedKahn(graph: Record<string, string[]>): boolean {
  const inDegree: Record<string, number> = {};
  const queue: string[] = [];
  const topoSorted: string[] = [];

  // Initialize in-degree
  for (const node in graph) {
    inDegree[node] = 0;
  }
  for (const node in graph) {
    for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
      inDegree[neighbor] = (inDegree[neighbor] || 0) + 1;
    }
  }

  // Enqueue nodes with 0 in-degree
  for (const node in inDegree) {
    if (inDegree[node] === 0) queue.push(node);
  }

  while (queue.length) {
    const current = queue.shift()!;
    topoSorted.push(current);

    for (const neighbor of graph[current] || []) {
      inDegree[neighbor]--;
      if (inDegree[neighbor] === 0) queue.push(neighbor);
    }
  }

  return topoSorted.length !== Object.keys(graph).length; // Cycle if any node is left
}
```

## üîç Observations and Misconceptions

* ‚úÖ **Undirected DFS** ‚Üí Must track parent node.
* ‚úÖ **Directed DFS** ‚Üí Must track recursion path (`path[]`).
* ‚ùå **BFS in Directed Graph** can't use `(node, parent)` ‚Äî edges are one-directional.
* ‚úÖ Use **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm** for BFS-based cycle detection in directed graphs.

### ‚ùó Misconception:

* Thinking visited\[] alone is enough in DFS for directed graphs ‚Äî you need `path[]` to detect back edges.

---

## üîô Backtracking Notes

### üîπ Undirected Graphs

* Edges are bidirectional.
* No explicit backtracking needed ‚Äî only check if neighbor is not the parent.

### üî∏ Directed Graphs

* Edges are unidirectional.
* Must remove node from `path[]` after DFS completes ‚Äî otherwise false cycles can be detected.
* This ensures proper exploration of alternate branches.

# Graph Cycle Detection: Time and Space Complexity

This document explains the time and space complexity of both DFS and BFS approaches for detecting cycles in an **undirected graph**, using adjacency list representation.

## ‚úÖ DFS-Based Cycle Detection (`isCycle()`)

### üìå Time Complexity

- The DFS visits each node and each edge **exactly once**.
- For an undirected graph:
  - Visiting nodes: **O(V)**
  - Visiting edges: **O(2E)** ‚Üí each edge is counted twice

**Overall Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`**

### üìå Space Complexity

- `visited` map stores up to `V` nodes ‚Üí **O(V)**
- Call stack may go as deep as `V` ‚Üí **O(V)** (worst case for recursion)

**Overall Space Complexity: `O(V)`**

---

## ‚úÖ BFS-Based Cycle Detection (`bfs()`)

### üìå Time Complexity

- Each node and edge is processed once during BFS traversal.
- For undirected graphs:
  - Visiting all nodes: **O(V)**
  - Visiting all edges: **O(2E)**

**Overall Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`**

### üìå Space Complexity

- `visited` map ‚Üí **O(V)**
- `queue` can hold up to `V` elements in worst case ‚Üí **O(V)**

**Overall Space Complexity: `O(V)`**

## üìã Summary Table

| Method           | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| `isCycle()` (DFS) | `O(V + E)`        | `O(V)`           |
| `bfs()` (BFS)     | `O(V + E)`        | `O(V)`           |

## üì¶ Bonus: Dependency Graph from `package.json`

* Tools like **dependency-cruiser** can analyze and visualize project dependencies.
* It can detect:

  * Circular dependencies
  * Orphans
  * Violations of custom rules

```bash
npm install --save-dev dependency-cruiser
npx depcruise src --output-type dot | dot -T svg > deps.svg
```

This generates a dependency graph you can visualize or inspect.

---

## üìà Future Ideas

* Visual tool for exploring `package.json` dependencies.
* Graph traversal for large monorepos.
* Real-time detection of circular dependencies during builds.
