## DSU Union by Rank Example

### What is DSU (Disjoint Set Union)?

Disjoint Set Union (also called Union-Find) is a data structure that keeps track of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. It provides near-constant-time operations to:

* **Find** the representative (or parent) of a set
* **Union** two sets together

This is commonly used in Kruskal's algorithm, cycle detection in graphs, and various dynamic connectivity problems.

To improve performance, two techniques are used:

* **Path Compression**: Flattens the structure of the tree whenever `findParent` is called.
* **Union by Rank**: Attaches the smaller tree under the larger one by comparing tree height (or rank).

### TypeScript DSU Implementation

```ts
export class DSU {
    public parents: number[] = [];
    public rank: number[] = [];

    constructor(size: number) {
        for (let i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
            this.parents[i] = i;
            this.rank[i] = 0;
        }
    }

    findParent(node: number): number {
        if (node === this.parents[node]) {
            return node;
        }
        this.parents[node] = this.findParent(this.parents[node]); // Path compression
        return this.parents[node];
    }

    findUnion(nodeu: number, nodev: number) {
        let pu = this.findParent(nodeu);
        let pv = this.findParent(nodev);

        if (pu === pv) return; // Already in the same component

        if (this.rank[pu] > this.rank[pv]) {
            this.parents[pv] = pu;
        } else if (this.rank[pu] < this.rank[pv]) {
            this.parents[pu] = pv;
        } else {
            this.parents[pv] = pu;
            this.rank[pu] += 1;
        }
    }

    getComponents(): number {
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i < this.parents.length; i++) {
            if (this.parents[i] === i) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Sample Usage

```ts
let dsu = new DSU(7);
dsu.findUnion(1, 2);
dsu.findUnion(2, 3);
dsu.findUnion(4, 5);
dsu.findUnion(6, 7);
dsu.findUnion(5, 6);
dsu.findUnion(3, 7);

console.log("Parent of node 2:", dsu.findParent(2));
console.log("Total Components:", dsu.getComponents());
```

### Real-World Scenario

We have two trees, each with a depth of 1:

**Tree A (Root: 1)**

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

* `rank[1] = 1`

**Tree B (Root: 4)**

```
    4
   / \
  5   6
```

* `rank[4] = 1`

### Union Operation

We call:

```ts
findUnion(1, 4)
```

### Step-by-step:

1. `findParent(1)` returns `1`
2. `findParent(4)` returns `4`
3. Both `rank[1]` and `rank[4]` are `1`

Since the ranks are equal:

* Attach one root under the other (let's attach `4` under `1`)
* Update `rank[1] += 1` â†’ now `rank[1] = 2`

### Resulting Tree

```
    1
   /|\
  2 3 4
       / \
      5   6
```

### Explanation

* The height of the new tree increases from 1 to 2.
* Therefore, we increase the rank of the new root (1).
* This helps maintain a relatively flat structure in future unions.

### Union-by-Rank Rule Summary

| Rank A | Rank B | Action           | Rank Update   |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| <      | >      | Attach A under B | No change     |
| >      | <      | Attach B under A | No change     |
| =      | =      | Attach B under A | A's rank += 1 |

This strategy ensures the trees remain as flat as possible, improving the efficiency of future `find` operations.
