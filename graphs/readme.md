# 547 province problem
 - turn n*n matrix into adjlist and bfs and iterate over the nodes add counter++ if for each pass of nodes
 - for the first node -> if its not visited then counter becomes 1 and then after it traverse through all connected and then second for loop another connected components which are indepent which counter becomes 2 
 - tc: 0(n^2) sc:o(n) -> not best approach as turn matrix to adjaceny list is not good we can directly perform on 2d matrix
