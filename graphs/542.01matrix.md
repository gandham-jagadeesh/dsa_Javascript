# 📘 README: Distance to the Nearest 0 in a Binary Matrix

## 🔧 Problem Statement

Given a binary matrix `mat` of size `m x n`, return a matrix where each cell contains the **distance to the nearest 0**.

- The distance between two adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) is `1`.
- All distances must be the shortest possible.

---

### ✅ Example 1:

**Input:**
```ts
[
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
Output:

ts

[
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
✅ Example 2:
Input:

ts

[
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
Output:



[
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 2, 1]
]
🧠 My Initial (Incorrect) Thinking
❌ Idea:
For each 1 cell, check neighbors.

If any neighbor is 0, mark it as 1.

Otherwise keep checking until a zero is found.

🔥 What Went Wrong:
If neighbors are also 1, it doesn't work.

Requires multiple passes or recursive depth.

Not efficient or guaranteed to converge quickly.

✅ Correct Approach: Multi-Source BFS

🧠 Why Multi-Source?

Treat all 0s as starting points and perform BFS from all zeros at the same time.

📈 Benefits:
Processes cells in distance order.

The first time you visit a cell, you've found its shortest distance to any 0.

No need to manually use min() or check other paths.

🔁 BFS Steps
Initialize:

Create a resultMatrix filled with Infinity.

Replace all 0s with 0 in resultMatrix and push their coordinates into a queue.

Perform BFS:

Pop cells from the queue.

For each neighbor:

If still Infinity, set distance = current + 1 and enqueue.

⚠️ Common Mistakes I Made
1. ❌ Wrong Direction Array:
ts

const directions = [[1,0], [-1,0], [0,1], [-1,0]]; // WRONG
✅ Correct:

ts
Copy
Edit
const directions = [[1,0], [-1,0], [0,1], [0,-1]];
2. ❌ Incorrect Access:
ts

let ny = y + dir[y]; // WRONG: Should be dir[1]
✅ Correct:

ts
Copy
Edit
let ny = y + dir[1];
3. ❌ Bad Matrix Initialization:
ts
Copy
Edit
let resultMatrix = new Array().fill(Infinity); // Incorrect
✅ Correct:

ts

const resultMatrix = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(Infinity));
🧱 What does Array.from(...) mean?
ts

const resultMatrix = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(Infinity));
Creates rows number of arrays.

Each sub-array has cols elements, filled with Infinity.

This avoids shared references (a common bug).

💻 Final Working TypeScript Code
ts

function updateMatrix(mat: number[][]): number[][] {
    const rows = mat.length;
    const cols = mat[0].length;

    const resultMatrix: number[][] = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(Infinity));
    const queue: number[][] = [];

    // Initialize queue with all 0s
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (mat[r][c] === 0) {
                resultMatrix[r][c] = 0;
                queue.push([r, c]);
            }
        }
    }

    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [x, y] = queue.shift()!;
        const value = resultMatrix[x][y];

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;

            if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < rows && ny < cols) {
                if (resultMatrix[nx][ny] === Infinity) {
                    resultMatrix[nx][ny] = value + 1;
                    queue.push([nx, ny]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return resultMatrix;
}
🧪 Test Case


console.log(updateMatrix([
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1]
]));
✅ Output:


[
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 2, 1]
]

Time & Space Complexity Analysis
🔄 Time Complexity: O(m × n)
We traverse each cell at most once.

In the worst case, all m × n cells are either 1s needing distance, or 0s that enqueue neighbors.

Each cell enters the queue only once.

Each direction check (4 directions) is constant time.

✅ Final Time Complexity:
O(m × n)


🧠 Space Complexity: O(m × n)
Breakdown:

Result Matrix (res):

Size is m × n, stores final distances.
→ O(m × n)

Queue:

In worst case, every cell is visited and enqueued once.
→ O(m × n)

Auxiliary Constants:

Directions array and loop variables are O(1).

✅ Final Space Complexity:
O(m × n)


🚀 What I Learned
BFS from multiple sources is incredibly powerful for shortest distance problems.

BFS naturally handles shortest path via layer-wise traversal.

Array.from ensures unique subarrays — avoids reference bugs.

Clear understanding of queue mechanics helps debug tough bugs fast.
