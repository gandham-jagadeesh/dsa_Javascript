# Eventual Safe Nodes

## 🌟 Goal

Find all "safe" nodes in a directed graph. A node is considered **safe** if every path starting from it eventually leads to a **terminal node** (a node with no outgoing edges).

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts

* **Terminal Nodes**: Nodes with no outgoing edges.
* **Safe Nodes**: Nodes from which all paths eventually lead to a terminal node or another safe node.
* Cycles are **unsafe** — any path that could fall into a cycle makes the starting node unsafe.

---

## 📘 OneNote Diagram Breakdown

Your diagram effectively illustrates:

* **Original Graph** with node connections (visualized with arrows).
* Concept of **Terminal Nodes** highlighted in red.
* Why we **reverse the graph**: to trace paths from terminal nodes backward.
* Example showing how **incoming edges** decrease when a terminal/safe node is removed.
* A **cycle** (0 → 1 → 3 → 0) is marked, indicating unsafe nodes.
* Step-by-step explanation of how a node becomes part of the **topological sort**.

This aligns perfectly with the safe node approach and reinforces:

> "All paths from a node must eventually reach a terminal node."

## 📈 Strategy

We use a **reverse graph** and **topological sorting** to find safe nodes:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Reverse the Graph**: For each edge `u → v`, create a reversed edge `v → u`.
2. **Compute In-Degrees** of the reversed graph.
3. **Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm)**:

   * Start from nodes with in-degree `0` (terminal nodes in the original graph).
   * Repeatedly remove nodes and reduce the in-degree of their neighbors.
   * Nodes that become zero in-degree are also safe.
4. **Sort and Return** all nodes that were visited (i.e., safe nodes).

## 🔀 Example

Original Graph:

```
graph = [
  [1, 2],  // 0
  [2, 3],  // 1
  [5],     // 2
  [0],     // 3
  [5],     // 4
  [],      // 5
  []       // 6
]
```

Reversed Graph:

```
0 → [3]  
1 → [0]  
2 → [0,1]  
3 → [1]  
4 → []  
5 → [2,4]  
6 → []  
```

Topologically sorted (safe) nodes:
`[2, 4, 5, 6]` — in ascending order: **`[2, 4, 5, 6]`**

## ✅ Code

```ts
function eventualSafeNodes(graph: number[][]): number[] {
    let length = graph.length;
    let indegree: number[] = new Array(length).fill(0);
    let adjGraph = new Map<number, number[]>();
    let result: number[] = [];
    let visited = new Map<number, boolean>();

    // Build reversed graph
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) adjGraph.set(i, []);
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        for (let adj of graph[i]) {
            adjGraph.get(adj).push(i);
        }
    }

    // Calculate indegrees for reversed graph
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        for (let adj of adjGraph.get(i)) {
            indegree[adj]++;
        }
    }

    // Topological sort (Kahn's)
    const queue: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
            visited.set(i, true);
        }
    }

    while (queue.length) {
        const node = queue.shift()!;
        result.push(node);
        for (let neighbor of adjGraph.get(node)) {
            indegree[neighbor]--;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] === 0 && !visited.has(i)) {
                queue.push(i);
                visited.set(i, true);
            }
        }
    }

    result.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return result;
}
```

## 🧠 Why Reverse the Graph?

Because we want to know which nodes **lead into** terminal nodes. A safe node should always eventually **reach** a terminal node — by reversing the graph, we can follow paths **backwards** from terminal nodes and collect all such nodes in a topological sort.

---

## ✅ Output for Above Example

```ts
console.log(eventualSafeNodes(graph)); 
// Output: [2, 4, 5, 6]
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* Topological sort only works on **acyclic** parts of the graph.
* Cycles (like `0 → 1 → 3 → 0`) will not be part of the final safe set.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**

* `V`: Number of vertices (nodes).
* `E`: Number of edges.
* Reversing the graph, calculating in-degrees, and performing BFS all take linear time relative to the size of the graph.

### Space Complexity: **O(V + E)**

* Adjacency list storage of the reversed graph takes `O(V + E)`.
* Indegree array and visited map take `O(V)`.
* Queue and result array use up to `O(V)` space.

Efficient for large sparse graphs!

## ⚙️ Alternate & Optimized Approaches

### 1. **DFS with Coloring**

* Use DFS to detect cycles and mark nodes:

  * `0`: unvisited
  * `1`: visiting
  * `2`: safe
* Mark nodes as **safe** if DFS from that node doesn’t enter any cycle.

**Pros:** Easier to implement recursively.
**Cons:** Uses recursion stack, not suitable for very deep graphs.

### 2. **Kahn’s Algorithm (Current Approach)**

* Reverse the graph and perform topological sort from terminal nodes.

**Pros:** Non-recursive, good for large graphs.
**Cons:** Requires reversing the graph.

### 3. **Naive DFS**

* Explore all paths from each node and check if any enters a cycle.

**Pros:** Conceptually simple.
**Cons:** Extremely inefficient for large graphs due to repeated work.

### Optimization Ideas

* Use memoization in DFS to cache safe/unsafe nodes.
* Use a single loop to maintain and propagate safe status in reversed graph.
* Avoid full rebuild of reversed graph by using a map structure or transposed index-based array.
