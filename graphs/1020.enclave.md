# Number of Enclaves 🏝️

## 🧩 Problem
You are given a binary matrix `grid` where:
- `0` represents sea
- `1` represents land

An enclave is a land cell that **cannot reach the boundary** of the grid by moving only up/down/left/right through other land cells.

Return the number of such enclave cells.

---

## ✅ Approach

### Step 1: Flood fill all land connected to the boundary.
We perform DFS (or BFS) starting from all edge cells (first/last row, first/last column) and mark any reachable `1`s as `0`.

### Step 2: Count the remaining `1`s.
These are land cells that are completely enclosed.

## ✏️ My First Attempt

### 🔧 Code
```ts
function numEnclaves(grid: number[][]): number {
    let rlength = grid.length;
    let clength = grid[0].length;
    let count =0;

    for(let r=0;r<rlength;r++){
        dfs(r,0);
        dfs(r,clength-1);
    }

    for(let c=0;c<clength;c++){
        dfs(0,c);
        dfs(rlength-1,c);
    }

    function dfs(r,c){
        if(r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rlength || c >= clength || r !== 1){
            return;
        }
        grid[r][c] = 0;
        const directions = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]];
        for(let dir of directions){
            let nx = r+dir[0];
            let ny = c+dir[1];
            dfs(nx,ny);
        }
    }

    for(let r=0;r<rlength;r++){
        for(let c=0;c<clength;c++){
            if(grid[r][c] === 1){
                count+=1;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};


🐞 Mistakes I Made
Mistake	Why it's wrong	Fix
r !== 1 in DFS condition	I was accidentally checking the row number, not whether the cell is land	Should be grid[r][c] !== 1
r > rlength, c > clength	Index bounds should be >=, not >	Use r >= rlength and c >= clength
Directions array duplicated [1,0] and missed [0,1]	Incomplete 4-directional movement	Use [[1,0], [-1,0], [0,-1], [0,1]]

🤓 Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(m * n) — every cell visited at most once
Space	O(m * n) worst case (DFS stack or BFS queue)

Where m = grid.length and n = grid[0].length.

✅ Final Notes
🧠 Reminder to Myself
Don’t mix up row index (r) and cell value (grid[r][c])

Always double-check boundary conditions

Make sure all 4 directions are handled

DFS is great for marking connected regions — use it confidently

🤔 When to Use BFS vs DFS?
Use Case	Prefer
Flood-fill / connected components	DFS
Shortest path / layer-by-layer traversal	BFS

✅ Final Working DFS Version
ts

function numEnclaves(grid: number[][]): number {
    const rlength = grid.length;
    const clength = grid[0].length;
    let count = 0;

    function dfs(r: number, c: number) {
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rlength || c >= clength || grid[r][c] !== 1) {
            return;
        }
        grid[r][c] = 0;

        const directions = [[1,0], [-1,0], [0,-1], [0,1]];
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            dfs(r + dx, c + dy);
        }
    }

    for (let r = 0; r < rlength; r++) {
        dfs(r, 0);
        dfs(r, clength - 1);
    }

    for (let c = 0; c < clength; c++) {
        dfs(0, c);
        dfs(rlength - 1, c);
    }

    for (let r = 0; r < rlength; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < clength; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === 1) count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
