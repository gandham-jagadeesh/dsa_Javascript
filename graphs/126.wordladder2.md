# Word Ladder II - TypeScript Implementation and Analysis

This document contains a breakdown of the algorithm used in a TypeScript implementation of the Word Ladder II problem, including code structure, phases, and time complexity analysis.

---

## Overview

The solution consists of two main phases:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to build an adjacency graph of valid word transformations with minimal path depth.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to backtrack through the graph and collect all valid shortest paths from `beginWord` to `endWord`.

## Code Snippet (Key Functions)

```ts
function validNeighbour(a: string, b: string): boolean {
    let diff = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] !== b[i]) diff++;
        if (diff > 1) return false;
    }
    return diff === 1;
}

function findLadders(beginWord: string, endWord: string, wordList: string[]): string[][] {
    const level = new Map<string, number>();
    const adjGraph = new Map<string, string[]>();
    const wordSet = new Set(wordList);
    const result: string[][] = [];

    if (!wordSet.has(endWord)) return [];

    const queue: string[] = [];
    level.set(beginWord, 0);
    queue.push(beginWord);

    while (queue.length) {
        const currNode = queue.shift()!;
        const currLevel = level.get(currNode)!;

        for (const word of wordSet) {
            if (validNeighbour(currNode, word)) {
                if (level.has(word)) {
                    if (level.get(word) === currLevel + 1) {
                        if (!adjGraph.has(currNode)) adjGraph.set(currNode, []);
                        adjGraph.get(currNode)!.push(word);
                    }
                } else {
                    queue.push(word);
                    level.set(word, currLevel + 1);
                    if (!adjGraph.has(currNode)) adjGraph.set(currNode, []);
                    adjGraph.get(currNode)!.push(word);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    const path: string[] = [];

    const dfs = (word: string) => {
        path.push(word);
        if (word === endWord) {
            result.push([...path]);
        } else if (adjGraph.has(word)) {
            for (const next of adjGraph.get(word)!) {
                dfs(next);
            }
        }
        path.pop();
    };

    dfs(beginWord);
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

Let:

* `N` = number of words in `wordList`
* `L` = length of each word
* `P` = number of valid shortest transformation paths

### BFS Phase

* For each word in the queue, we loop over all `N` words to check for valid neighbors using `validNeighbour`.
* `validNeighbour` takes `O(L)` time.

**Time Complexity:**

```
O(N^2 * L)
```

### DFS Phase

* We may explore up to `P` paths.
* Each path can be of length `N` (in the worst case).

**Time Complexity:**

```
O(P * N)
```

### Total Time Complexity

Combining both:

```
O(N^2 * L + P * N)
```

## Optimization Suggestion

Instead of checking `validNeighbour(a, b)` by looping over all words, generate neighbors by mutating each character:

* For each character in the word (L positions), try 26 possible substitutions.
* This reduces BFS complexity to:

**Optimized BFS Time Complexity:**

```
O(N * L^2)
```

Would require storing neighbors differently, but is more efficient for large dictionaries.

---

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a clear and effective method for solving the Word Ladder II problem using BFS + DFS. However, performance can be further optimized by generating neighbors directly rather than scanning the entire w
