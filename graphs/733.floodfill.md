 Issues:
1. Redundant visited Map
You're using a visited map to track visited cells, but you're also changing the pixel color immediately, which inherently acts as a visited marker.

✅ Fix: You can remove the visited map entirely, since setting the color to the new value ensures you won't revisit it.

2. Edge Case: Target Color = New Color
If the new color is the same as the original color at sr, sc, your algorithm will go into an infinite loop or do redundant work.

✅ Fix: Add a check at the beginning:


if (image[sr][sc] === color) return image;
✅ Cleaned-up Version:
```ts
function floodFill(image: number[][], sr: number, sc: number, color: number): number[][] {
    const target = image[sr][sc];
    if (target === color) return image;

    const queue: [number, number][] = [[sr, sc]];
    const height = image.length;
    const width = image[0].length;
    const directions = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[0,-1]];

    image[sr][sc] = color;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [r, c] = queue.shift()!;
        for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nr = r + dr, nc = c + dc;
            if (
                nr >= 0 && nc >= 0 &&
                nr < height && nc < width &&
                image[nr][nc] === target
            ) {
                image[nr][nc] = color;
                queue.push([nr, nc]);
            }
        }
    }

    return image;
}
``` 
⚠️ Important Design Decision:
The original implementation modified the image in-place to mark visited cells.

However, the problem does not explicitly state that the image should be mutated.

🔁 Lesson Learned: It's generally safer to avoid in-place modification unless:

The problem clearly asks for it, or

You're returning a new deep copy.

In real-world or production scenarios, mutating input data can lead to unexpected side effects and data integrity issues.
