#### Basic idea: just found the length of diff characters between startGene and EndGene 
- example : 
            Input: startGene = "AACCGGTT", endGene = "AAACGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA","AACCGCTA","AAACGGTA"]
            Diff between startGene and endGene is A,T so output is 2 
            replace the C in the input and put A and check whether we found a valid gene
            AAACCGTT -> valid
            replace the T in the input and put A and check whether we found a valid gene 
            AAACCGTA -> valid 



üß¨ Minimum Genetic Mutation ‚Äì Why Greedy Replacement Fails
‚ùì Problem Summary
You are given:

startGene: a starting 8-letter gene string

endGene: a target gene string

bank: a list of valid gene strings

Each move:

Must mutate exactly one character

The result must be in the bank

Goal: Find the minimum number of mutations from start to end.

ü§î Misconception: Just Change the Different Characters
It might seem like you can:

Find which characters differ between startGene and endGene

Change them one-by-one in order

Check each mutation in the bank

‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Fails
This greedy approach fails if an intermediate mutation is not in the bank.

üîÅ Under the Hood: You're Doing Graph Traversal
Even if you:

Don‚Äôt use bfs() or dfs() explicitly

Just manually mutate one character at a time

Check for valid mutations in the bank

You‚Äôre still:

üîç Exploring nodes and checking edges ‚Äî i.e., doing graph traversal.

üß† Core Logic
A valid move is when a gene differs from current by exactly one character and is in the bank.

That creates an implicit graph:

Nodes = valid gene strings

Edges = 1-character mutations

You can:

Use BFS for shortest path

Or do your own version by simulating the search


-- explaination

Think of it this way: If you're getting an intermediate "mutation string" that isn't in the bank, you shouldn't have gotten that mutation string at all.

You shouldn't be applying arbitrary mutations to get from start to end, but rather picking out the next possible mutations of start from the bank. In your example, you should have never gotten that string to begin with, because it's invalid. To see the error with your methodology, consider the case below:

start = aaccttgg

end = aaccttca

bank = aaccttca, aaccttag, aaccttaa

The shortest path from start to end using mutations from bank is aaccttgg => aaccttag => aaccttaa => aaccttca.

A rudimentary algorithm might simply be looking to replace one of the last two letters in the start with one of the last two letters in end (ex. aaccttcg or aaccttga), since those are the two letters that are different between the two; however, there are no such strings in the bank that follow such a mutation path. In reality the solution is to go through a mutation that, at a glance, doesn't seem to get you any closer to the solution (going from aaccttgg => aaccttag, the end still has two different letters, which isn't an improvement over the start, which makes it seem like you're not getting any closer). If your solution is just replacing letters in start with the desirable letters from end and then checking if your mutation is in the bank, you aren't going to get the right solution in many cases.

Similarly, you could arrive at a situation where it looks like you're getting closer (reducing the number of different letters between end and your mutated string) but then have no possible next mutations from that point. There solution in that case may instead be heading towards a mutation that doesn't reduce the difference between your mutation and the end string at all.

Remember that the answer isn't the minimum number of letters to change to get from start to end (which is just sum(a!=b for a,b in zip(start, end)), but the minimum number of strings in the bank that you can mutate through to get from start to end. Each step doesn't necessarily need to look visually closer to the end. In fact, they may get even further away, if only to open up possibilities for new mutations later that get you closer. To visualize this, try drawing a tree of some longer examples, starting with the start, draw branches out to every possible mutation from start to strings in bank, and then from each of the strings in bank to other strings in bank (taking care not to accidentally go backwards). The number of steps in the shortest path through that tree to the end is your answer.



üß¨ Mutation Rule Clarification
In Minimum Genetic Mutation, two strings (genes) are considered connected (1 valid mutation apart) only if:

They differ by exactly one character.

The rest of the characters must be identical and in the same positions.

It's not enough to have the same characters in a different order ‚Äî position matters.

‚úÖ Valid example:

"AACCGGTT" ‚Üí "AACCGGTA" // Only index 7 changed (T ‚Üí A)
‚ùå Invalid example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
"AACCGGTT" vs "TTGGCCAA" // Characters rearranged ‚Äî not a valid mutation
Always compare characters at the same index. The mutation must occur at one specific gene position.
